# Elm generator
A tiny cli tool that automates some component file creation I was repeating by hand.

# To use it
```bash
npm install --global tylerdiaz/elm-generator
```
Then inside your elm source directory:
```bash
elm-gen Feature
```

you can also do nested features:
```bash
elm-gen App/Auth/Login
```
